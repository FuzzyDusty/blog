# Welcome to My Blog!

A little about me:

- I am a grad student studying cyber security engineering at USC Viterbi
- My undergrad was medical microbiology

I am learning how to use the github environment so I can "get good" (That's what my friends say anyways)

Anywho, even though this platform is intimidating at first, it's important to know that this is a learning experience, and you gotta start somewhere!
