# Welcome to My Blog!

A little about me:

- I am a grad student studying cyber security engineering at USC Viterbi
- My undergrad was medical microbiology

I am learning how to use the github environment so I can "get good" (That's what my friends say anyways)

Anywho, even though this platform is intimidating at first, it's important to know that us noobs are in it together, and you gotta start somewhere!
