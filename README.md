# ~~~ Welcome to FuzzyDusty's Corner of the Interweb ~~~

A little about me:

- I am a grad student studying cyber security engineering at USC
- My undergrad was in medical microbiology

# How did I get into Cybersecurity?

It actually has been one of my hobbies since I was a kid. My dad's computer was compromised by malware that changed his browser's DNS settings. This meant typing "REI.com" would redirect to a spam/ad website. This opened my eyes to the power of the hidden protocols that power all of our internet connected activity today.

In high school I co-founded the Cyber Patriot Club, where we as a team of 6 students, competed in Cyber Patriot Competitions. These were CTFs designed by the American Air Force that were on Windows 10, Windows 2017 Server, Linux Distributions, etc. We did not have a cyber security teacher, so we took it upon ourselves to teach ourselves cyber security. 

My story continues, but to keep it simple-- I am in the great process of diving into everything that cybersecurity has to offer. 

You're welcome to follow along on the projects I publish that I am working on below :)
