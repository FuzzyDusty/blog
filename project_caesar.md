# Project Caesar

For my first project, I am going to make a caesar cipher in python!

# What is a Caesar Cipher?

- An rudimentry cipher algorithm that "shifts" an alphabet. For example below, the alphabet is shifted by 3. You can kind of think of it like you have 2 giant rings. The top ring is the full alphabet, and the bottom ring is the full alphabet as well. What you do is "turn" the bottom alphabet, so the "A" now corresponds to "X" for instance.

# What is the coding logic?

- In my opinion, once the logic for the algorithm has been determined, the actual coding is easy. In this example, using mod is going to be our best friend!
