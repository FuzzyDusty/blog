# Guiding Post

Welcome to my GitHub Pages blog! This is where I’ll share updates on my projects and what I’m learning.

Right now I am using gracenolan's notes (I am not sure how to reference them oops) to work on my cybersecurity coding skills.
They highlighted a few topics that I am going to attempt to code in python. I am listing out their topics here:
"
- Cyphers / encryption algorithms
- Parse arbitrary logs
- Collect logs (of any kind) and write a parser which pulls out specific details (domains, executable names, timestamps etc.)
- Web scrapers
- Write a script to scrape information from a website.
- Port scanners
- Write a port scanner or detect port scanning.
- Botnets
- How would you build ssh botnet?
- Password bruteforcer
- Generate credentials and store successful logins.
- Scrape metadata from PDFs
- Write a mini forensics tool to collect identifying information from PDF metadata.
- Recover deleted items
- Most software will keep deleted items for ~30 days for recovery. Find out where these are stored.
    Write a script to pull these items from local databases.
- Malware signatures
- A program that looks for malware signatures in binaries and code samples.
    Look at Yara rules for examples.
" (these bullets are from gracenolan's page).

Thanks for stopping by!
